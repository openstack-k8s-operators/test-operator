                              NoExecute.

                              applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the

                              means to match all values and all keys.

                              to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal.
                              Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard
                              for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of
                              a particular category.

                              otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.
                              By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the
                              taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values
                              will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
