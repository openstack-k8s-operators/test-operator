=============================
CRs Used By the test-operator
=============================

This file contains definitions of all custom resources (CRs) that are accepted by
the test-operator. Currently, there are two CRs accepted by the test-operator:

* :ref:`tempest-custom-resource`

* :ref:`tobiko-custom-resource`


.. _tempest-custom-resource:

Tempest Custom Resource
=======================

.. literalinclude:: ../../config/samples/test_v1beta1_tempest.yaml
   :language: yaml


.. _tobiko-custom-resource:

Tobiko Custom Resource
======================

.. literalinclude:: ../../config/samples/test_v1beta1_tobiko.yaml
   :language: yaml


.. _horizontest-custom-resource:

HorizonTest Custom Resource
===========================

.. literalinclude:: ../../config/samples/test_v1beta1_horizontest.yaml
   :language: yaml


.. _ansibletest-custom-resource:

AnsibleTest Custom Resource
===========================

.. literalinclude:: ../../config/samples/test_v1beta1_ansibletests.yaml
   :language: yaml


.. _parallel-execution:

Parallel Execution
==================
By default, test-operator runs pods serially. The reason for this is to prevent
collisions between tests (e.g., two tests from two different frameworks modifying
the same resource). So, for example, if you run the following two commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   oc apply -f crd1.yaml
   oc apply -f crd2.yaml

where :code:`crd1.yaml` and :code:`crd2.yaml` are, let's say, two Tobiko CRs, then
you will first see a test pod executing tests defined by :code:`crd1.yaml`. After
the test pod finishes, you will see a second test pod that will be executing tests
specified in :code:`crd2.yaml`.

If you want to run multiple test pods at the same time, then you need to set
:code:`parallel: true` in the :code:`Spec` section in both :code:`crd1.yaml`
and :code:`crd2.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: test.openstack.org/v1beta1
   kind: Tobiko
   metadata:
     name: crd1
     namespace: openstack
   spec:
     parallel: true # <-- HERE
     testenv: py3
   ---
   apiVersion: test.openstack.org/v1beta1
   kind: Tobiko
   metadata:
     name: crd1
     namespace: openstack
   spec:
     parallel: true # <-- HERE
     testenv: py3

.. _workflow:

Workflow Section
================
The workflow section enables the spawning of multiple test pods at the same
time. For example, in the Tempest CR shown below, two test pods are spawned,
each corresponding to a different step. Each step inherits a configuration
that is specified outside the workflow section. In individual steps, you can
overwrite values specified in the :code:`tempestRun` and
:code:`tempestconfRun` sections.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  apiVersion: test.openstack.org/v1beta1
  kind: Tempest
  metadata:
    name: tempest-tests
    namespace: openstack
  spec:
    containerImage: ""
    # parallel: true # <-- Uncomment for parallel execution
    tempestRun:
    includeList: |
      tempest.api.identity.v3.*
    concurrency: 8
    tempestconfRun:
    workflow:
      - stepName: first-step
        tempestRun:
          includeList: |
            tempest.api.*
      - stepName: second-step
        tempestRun:
          includeList: |
            neutron_tempest_plugin.*

By default, test pods are executed sequentially. To enable parallel
execution of test pods, you need to set :code:`parallel: true` in the
:code:`spec` section.

CRs that can use the workflow section:

* :ref:`tempest-custom-resource`

* :ref:`tobiko-custom-resource`

* :ref:`ansibletest-custom-resource`
